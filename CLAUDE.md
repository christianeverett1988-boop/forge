# Working agreement for Claude on Forge

Forge is Christian Everett's personal fitness app. It's a PWA on GitHub Pages plus Firebase project `forge-web-f2351` and Cloud Functions in `functions/`. The goal is to beat Fitbod, Workouts for Men and Withings+ on features and polish, not just to be correct.

## Who does what
- **Christian (owner):** merges PRs, and does anything that needs his own devices or accounts: deploying Cloud Functions from his Mac, the Firebase or Google Cloud console, the Withings developer dashboard, and secrets. He does not want to relay messages between us or be asked to check in.
- **His review bot (comments as christianeverett1988-boop, tags @claude):** it writes specs, opens issues, opens PRs from your branches, reviews them, renders the UI at iPhone size, and sends you fixes. It speaks for Christian on scope and priorities.
- **You (Claude):** build, test, push to your branch, and report back in the issue/PR comment.

## How we work without Christian
- Don't wait on Christian for anything except a merge or a step only he can do. If you need a product decision, make the sensible call that fits the brief, note it in your summary, and keep going. The review bot will correct course if needed.
- Every summary ends with: what changed, test results, anything skipped and why, and **whether Cloud Functions or `firestore.rules` changed** (those need Christian to redeploy or publish).
- Keep `config.js` as committed. Never commit secrets or tokens. The repo is public.
- **Privacy:** never commit Christian's real health data, Withings exports, photos, or GPS. Use synthetic fixtures in tests.
- Run `node tests/run.js` and `npm --prefix functions install && npm --prefix functions test` before pushing. Rules tests run in CI.
- Bump `js/version.js` and `sw.js` and add a CHANGELOG entry for each release.
- UX bar: iPhone-first, one-handed use, big tap targets, plain friendly words, respects reduced motion and safe areas. Christian's wife also uses the app (her own account).

## Roadmap (in order; specs and reviews live in `notes/`)
1. v0.4.4: M1/M2 + first-run tour (PR #14).
2. **W2a:** Apple Health ingest (`healthIngest`, Shortcut token, Apple Health zip import), Readiness, Forge Score. Target about Oct 15–17, 2026.
3. **W2b:** trends, weekly report, insights. Must ship before **Nov 1, 2026**, when Christian's Withings+ access ends. See `notes/brief-addendum-3-withings-plus-replacement.md`.
4. Food logging (Checkpoint C; needs a USDA FoodData Central key from Christian).
5. Weekly progress photos (stored on the device only, time-lapse export, on-device comparisons, opt-in AI analysis).
6. Home gym equipment profile from Christian's photos, plus YMCA and full bodyweight coverage.
7. AI coach.
8. Phase 3: native wrapper (Capacitor).

The review bot will open an issue for each item with the spec. If you finish early, propose the next step in your summary.
