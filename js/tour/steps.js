// The first-run how-to tour: what it says, when it shows, and the Next / Back / Skip state machine.
// Pure (no DOM, no Firebase), so the rules are unit-tested; js/tour/tour.js draws it.
//
// When it shows: only for a brand-new account. Finishing onboarding for the first time writes
// profile.tour = 'pending'; finishing or skipping the tour writes profile.tour = 'seen' (+ tour_seen_at).
// Accounts that already existed have no `tour` field, so they never get it on their own; Settings →
// "Show the how-to tour again" replays it for anyone. It lives in the profile doc, not localStorage, so it
// doesn't come back on a new phone.

// target: a CSS selector for the real element to spotlight (null = no spotlight, just the card).
// route: the screen the target is on; the tour opens it first.
