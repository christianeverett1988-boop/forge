// Missions from live state. Everything is derived from weights, body_measures, workouts, cardio and
// health_daily (and food_logs once they exist); the only stored state is in settings/main:
//   missions_started  the first local day missions counted for XP (never earlier: no retroactive XP)
//   mission_steps     step target (default 8,000)       mission_bed   bedtime target 'HH:MM' (default 23:00)
//   missions_seen     { day: [mission ids already shown as done] } for the last two weeks, so a check springs once
